# Access Code Code of Conduct

All coordinators, instructors, students and volunteers at any Access Code event are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Coordinators will enforce this code throughout the program.

##The Quick Version

Access Code is dedicated to providing a harassment-free classroom experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any venue. Class participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the program at the discretion of the program managers.

##The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Class participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the program managers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the program.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact [Aliya](mailto:aliya@c4q.nyc), [AQ](mailto:aq@c4q.nyc), or any of the C4Q staff immediately.

C4Q staff will be happy to help participants contact security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the program. We value your presence and safety.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all C4Q locations and all Access Code related related events.
